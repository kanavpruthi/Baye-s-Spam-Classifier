# Baye-s-Spam-Classifier

This program is an Email spam/ non spam classifier that I've made in Jupyter Notebook using Python. A big set of emails(spam and non spam) was imported from spam assassin public corpus and was split into a training and testing data set. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Baye's theorem, thin out the body of the emails to the required words as tokens and work with them further with plain statistics based on Baye's Probability Theorem. Works like a charm, this gave an accuracy of >97%. 

This works on a given dataset and if you want to work with your own dataset, all you have to do is replace the current email files in the Pre-Processing notebooks with your own file formats and run the notebooks in the order Pre-processing --> Algorithm Training --> Testing and Evaluation. Images to be attached soon :)
